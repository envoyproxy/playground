Provides a Solid pod server on port `8443`

No environment variables are configured by default, but this image has many.

Refer to the [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodesolidserver/node-solid-server)
for further information on usage and configuration.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Solid node`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Solid node` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
- create an `Solid server (node)` service called `solid`
- connect the proxy and the `solid` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to view the following endpoints:

- [https://localhost:10000](https://localhost:10000)

Port `10000` is a `TCP` passthrough port that routes to the endpoint port of the `solid` service.

All `HTTPS` certificates are "snake-oil" so you will need to use `-k` with `curl`
or accept untrusted certificates if viewing in a browser.

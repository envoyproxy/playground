Provides a Redis server with no authentication by default.

Can be used for testing proxying to Redis, and for
testing Envoy's Redis filter.

There are many significant environment variables for this image,
[see the documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) for further
information on configuration and usage.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Redis`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Redis` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 20000 -> 20000 (Optional: admin)
- create a `Redis` service called `redis`
- connect the proxy and the `redis` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to connect to Redis on port `10000`.

You can view the Redis filter stats in the admin ui [http://localhost:20000/stats](http://localhost:20000/stats), if enabled.

Provides an example of a minimal asynchronous web server.

The service is configurable by editing the python `run.py`.

The default configuration listens on port `8080`.

This image does not have any significant environment variables.

Container has some other [aio-libs](https://github.com/aio-libs) installed for connecting
to `mariadb` and `postgres` servers.

To make use of the provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Python (asyncio)`) you will need to:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Python (asyncio)` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
- create a `Python (asyncio)` service called `python`
- connect the proxy and the `echo` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to view the following endpoints:

- [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)

Which should respond with the following text

```
Hello, aio world
```

This service provides an "all-in-one" Jaeger server for testing out network configurations with Jaeger.

The default configuration provides Zipkin compatibility with a REST API served on port `9411`.

This can be disabled by removing the default `COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Jaeger`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Jaeger` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 10001 -> 10001
- create an `Jaeger` service called `jaeger`
- create an `HTTP/S echo` service called `echo`
- connect the proxy, `jaeger`, and `echo` services together on a network

With this setup you should be able to view the following endpoints:

- [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)
- [http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001)

Port `10000` is an `HTTP` port that routes to the `echo` service.

Port `10001` is an `HTTP` port that proxies to the Jaeger web console.

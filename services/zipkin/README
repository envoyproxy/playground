This service provides a Zipkin server for testing out network configurations with Zipkin.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Zipkin`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Zipkin` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 10001 -> 10001
- create an `Zipkin` service called `zipkin`
- create an `HTTP/S echo` service called `echo`
- connect the proxy, `zipkin`, and `echo` services together on a network

With this setup you should be able to view the following endpoints:

- [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)
- [http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001)

Port `10000` is an `HTTP` port that routes to the `echo` service.

Port `10001` is an `HTTP` port that proxies to the Zipkin web console.

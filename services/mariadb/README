Provides a MariaDB server with no authentication by default.

Can be used for testing proxying to MariaDB and MySQL, and for
testing Envoy's MySQL filter.

Can also be used for testing proxying to services that require a MySQL/MariaDB
server.

There are many significant environment variables for this image,
[see the documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) for further
information on configuration and usage.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: MariaDB`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: MariaDB` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 20000 -> 20000 (Optional: admin)
- create a `MariaDB` service called `mariadb`
- connect the proxy and the `mariadb` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to connect to MariaDB on port `10000`.

``` console
$ mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=10000 -u root

You can view the MySQL filter stats in the admin ui [http://localhost:20000/stats](http://localhost:20000/stats), if enabled.

Echos back request and request headers as json.

`HTTP` and `HTTPS` listening ports can be configured with the `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT`
environment variables respectively.

This can be useful for testing a variety of situations.

For example, you might use it to test load balancing and routing setups where
you wish to see which upstream server handled the request.

It can also be useful for checking injected headers.

To make use of the example Envoy configuration you will need to:

- add this proxy mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 10001 -> 10001
  - 10002 -> 10002
- create an `http-echo` service called `echo`
- connect this proxy and the `echo` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to view the following endpoints:
- http://localhost:10000/http
- http://localhost:10000/https
- https://localhost:10001/http
- https://localhost:10001/https
- https://localhost:10002/https

Port `10000` is an `HTTP` port that routes the paths `/http` and `/https`
to the respective ports on the `echo` service.

Port `10001` is an `HTTPS` port that does the same.

Port `10002` is a `TCP` passthrough port that proxies to the `HTTPS` port
on the `echo` service.

All `HTTPS` certificates are "snake-oil" so you will need to use `-k` with `curl`
or accept untrusted certificates if viewing in a browser.

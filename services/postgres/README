Provides a PostgreSQL server with no authentication by default.

Can be used for testing proxying to PostgreSQL, and for
testing Envoy's PostgreSQL filter.

There are many significant environment variables for this image,
[see the documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for further
information on configuration and usage.

There is a provided example Envoy configuration (`Service: Postgres`).

To make use of it you should:

- add a proxy with the `Service: Postgres` configuration and mapping the following ports
  - 10000 -> 10000
  - 20000 -> 20000 (Optional: admin)
- create a `Postgres` service called `postgres`
- connect the proxy and the `postgres` service together on a network

With this setup you should be able to connect to Postgres on port `10000`.

You can view the PostgreSQL filter stats in the admin ui [http://localhost:20000/stats](http://localhost:20000/stats), if enabled.

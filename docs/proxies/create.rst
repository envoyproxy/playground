=====================

Envoy proxies provide the only way into your playground cloud network.

.. rst-class::  clearfi

Open the playground
-------------------

Open the playground, and click on the green ``+`` next to "Proxies".

This should open the proxy create dialogue.

.. tip::

   You can use ``ctrl+alt+p`` to open the create new proxy dialogue.

.. rst-class::  clearfix

Enter the proxy name
--------------------

Give the proxy a name.

It should be not too long and not too short, 4 or 5 characters is probably best.

The name should only include the characters a-z, 0-9, ``_``, ``-``, and ``.``.

Add an Envoy configuration
--------------------------

Once you have added the name, you will be able to configure the proxy.

At a mimimum you will need to provide an Envoy configuration.

A number of examples have been provided to work with the pre-installed services.
